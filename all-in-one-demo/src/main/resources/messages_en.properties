FieldGroupSelectNestedJavaBeans.beanItemContainerInfo=This selection component uses a <strong>com.vaadin.data.util.BeanItemContainer</strong> as its container data source:
FieldGroupSelectNestedJavaBeans.beanItemContainerTab=Department selector's container data source: BeanItemContainer
FieldGroupSelectNestedJavaBeans.department=Department
FieldGroupSelectNestedJavaBeans.description=This demo shows how to configure a FieldGroup that contains a selection component for selecting a nested JavaBean property of another JavaBean entity. In this example, there is an entity bean 'Employee' which contains a nested JavaBean property 'Department'. In the two forms shown on the tab-sheet you can add new Employee objects to the employee table. The first form uses a BeanItemContainer as the container data source of the department selection component. The second form uses an IndexedContainer as data model. For this second FieldGroup to work, it is necessary to set a specific converter on the selection component which converts between item ID and Department object. Of course, for the user both forms behave exactly the same which is the whole purpose of this tutorial. The difference between these two forms is only visible in code.

UsingSessionAndUIScope.shortDescription=This demo demonstrates the two different scopes of a Vaadin 7 session. These are the common session scope and the new UI scope. The UI scope represents the data needed for the contents of one browser window or tab opened from the same session. This example lets you edit one session-scoped and one UI-scoped variable. It then demonstrates that for each browser window opened from the same session, a new UI object is created that contains its own version of the UI-scoped variable.

componentHighlighter.description=<ul>\r\n    <li><a href="?debug#!/demo/ComponentHighlighterDemo">Switch highlighting labels on</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href="?debug=quiet#!/demo/ComponentHighlighterDemo">Switch labels on, but hide the debug console</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href="?#!/demo/ComponentHighlighterDemo">Switch the labels off</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Component Highlighter add-on is aimed at supporting the Vaadin developer while writing a Vaadin application. The add-on provides a component extension which will highlight the extended component in the browser with an eye-catching label containing the fully qualified class name of the extended component or a user-defined text. By that, you can see which part of your UI is implemented by which Java class directly in the browser. The extension is only active when the Vaadin application is running in debug mode. In production mode, the add-on will have no effect. A typical usage pattern for this add-on is shown by the following code:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class="sourcecode">\r\npublic class MyComponent extends CustomComponent {\r\n    ...\r\n    public MyComponent() {\r\n        super();\r\n        new ComponentHighlighterExtension(this);\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, a new local instance of the highlighter extension is created in the constructor of a CustomComponent. The CustomComponent is extended by the constructor of the ComponentHighlighterExtension if and only if the application is running in debug mode. Therefore, you don't need to check for the production mode yourself when creating new local instances of the extension. In production mode, local extension instances will simply fall through and will be removed by the garbage collector so no memory is wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlighting label is not visible in a running application in normal mode. These labels can be activated by switching on Vaadin's <span class="code">debug</span> mode using the <span class="code">debug</span> URL parameter. This parameter will usually open the Vaadin debug console. If you have extended any component in your application with the ComponentHighlighter add-on, the component will now be highlighted in the browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This demo application makes intensive use of the add-on. Using the following links, you can switch the highlighting labels on and off. This will work because the demo application is running in debug mode. The labels then decorate the DIV of the extended component and indicate the component implementation's class name.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Usage</h2>\r\n<p>In order to use this add-on in your own project, you have to add the add-on's module descriptor to your own widget set descriptor:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;module&gt;\r\n    &lt;inherits name="com.vaadin.DefaultWidgetSet" /&gt;\r\n    &lt;inherits name="org.vaadin.highlighter.ComponentHighlighterWidgetset" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/module&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href="https://vaadin.com/book" target="_blank">Book of Vaadin</a> extensively describes all necessary steps to include Vaadin addons into your project and how to compile your own widget set.</p>

i18nForCustomLayoutsUsingThymeleaf.description=<p>This demo uses <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a> templating for translating all of its CustomLayout templates. The demo description text you're reading right now is translated and maintained in a common Java resource bundle, as is the case with all the other translated texts of this application. You can change the language for this demo using the language selector combobox in the upper right corner.</p><p>The template files used for instantiating the CustomLayouts contain references to the translation keys defined in the resource bundles. You can take a look, for example, at the CustomLayout template of the main page <a href="https://github.com/rolandkrueger/vaadin-by-example/tree/master/all-in-one-demo/src/main/webapp/layouts/main.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Note that this demo uses a different approach for templating than described in the accompanying blog post. Instead of Apache Velocity, the Thymeleaf Templating Engine is used. This is because Velocity is no longer supported by the current version of Spring which is used by this demo. You can find the source code for this approach in service class <a href="https://github.com/rolandkrueger/vaadin-by-example/blob/master/all-in-one-demo/src/main/java/de/oio/vaadin/services/templating/impl/TemplatingServiceImpl.java">TemplatingService</a>.</p>

i18nForCustomLayoutsUsingThymeleaf.shortDescription=This example demonstrates how Vaadin CustomLayout templates can be localized with the <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a> templating engine. By that, it is possible to translate static text used in CustomLayouts into a user's locale.
SuggestingComboBox.shortDescription=This demo shows how you can tweak Vaadin's ComboBox in such a way that suggestions based on the user's input are drawn from some external service. By that, it is not necessary to load the whole set of available options into a Vaadin container. Suggestions can be calculated quickly outside of the ComboBox, e. g. by the database.

SuggestingComboBox.linkLabel=Link to Wikipedia for the selected page title\:
SuggestingComboBox.description=<p>The following ComboBox contains an excerpt of Wikipedia page titles. You can select one Wikipedia page title from a total of about 700,000 entries. You need to enter at least three letters before you get shown a suggestion. That's to keep the suggestion lists reasonably small. After you have made a selection, the link below the ComboBox is changed to link to the selected page.</p><p>Here are some numbers about the dataset accessible from the ComboBox\: the text file containing these page titles has a size of about 12 MB. The original Wikipedia page title export file would have been too large for this example with a size of about 200 MB. That's why I'm using only an excerpt. When I tried to load this 12 MB data file into a common BeanItemContainer it took me about 13 minutes on my computer. That's because inserting into a Vaadin BeanItemContainer is O(n\u00B2). Loading this dataset into <a href\="https\://github.com/rolandkrueger/RoKlib/blob/develop/RoKlib/src/main/java/org/roklib/collections/TernarySearchTreeSet.java">the data structure that I use</a> takes 2-3 seconds. This data structure is optimized for prefix matching.</p>
